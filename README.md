# Unity2D Components
This repository holds a varied collection of Unity3D components which I've been building for use in the 2D Platformer/RPG I'm currently developing. **It is very much a work in progress.** 

While I'm still fairly new to Unity3D and C#, I hope this repository can at least be a source of inspiration or information for those who seek it. Please feel free to take a look around.

The contents herein are by no means an entire gameâ€”they are more like puzzle pieces, which I am constantly enhancing, reworking, and adding to. More documentation will be coming, *as time permits.*

# Shoulders Of Giants...
Besides the rather simple components included here, within this codebase you will find reference to a number of other great software bundles, including the most excellent [CharacterController2D] (https://github.com/prime31/CharacterController2D), by Prime31, the incredibly useful [Advanced C# Messenger] (http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=Advanced_CSharp_Messenger), by Ilya Suzdalnitski, and perhaps my favorite add-on, [DOTween] (http://dotween.demigiant.com/), by Demigiant. All of these packages have been instrumental in the development of my current project.

Thanks for stopping by.
