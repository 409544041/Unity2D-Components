# Unity2D Components

This repository holds a varied collection of Unity3D components that I've been building for use in the 2D Platformer/RPG I'm currently developing. It's a work in progress, but please feel free to take a look around.

The contents herein are by no means an entire game—they are more like puzzle pieces that I'm constantly enhancing, reworking, and adding to. More documentation will be coming, *as time permits.*

## Installation

Hey hey—no installation required! This codebase is probably most useful as a collection of C# scripts you can peruse for examples and usage.

##On The Shoulders Of Giants...
Besides the components included here, within this collection you will find reference to a number of other great software bundles, including the most excellent [**CharacterController2D**] (https://github.com/prime31/CharacterController2D), by Prime31, the incredibly useful [**Advanced C# Messenger**] (http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=Advanced_CSharp_Messenger), by Ilya Suzdalnitski, and perhaps my favorite add-on, [**DOTween**] (http://dotween.demigiant.com/), by Demigiant. All of these packages have been instrumental in the development of my current project.

Thanks for stopping by.
