Give all tiles the DefaulTile prefab first.

Then, paint one of each tile onto the scene.

Click a tile, then go over to the Tile System in the heirarchy, and find the DefaulTile prefab associated with that tile. Add your colliders to that prefab, rename the prefab, and drag it into the tiles prefab folder. Make sure you set the y to zero. it will be a negative number by default.

Now go attach your new prefabs to the tiles.

Prefabs with colliders need to be using SpriteDiffuse material, with renderers turned on.

Tiles with no colliders: click "tile" in the heirarchy, and set to SpriteDiffuse material.

Solid tiles need to get the WallEntity component.
